# These scripts are unsafe. They are not meant for massive usage. They are just quick scripts i have needed at some point!

I needed a script to move a lot of folders on a customers IMAP mail. 
Apparently no email client support this, so i created this script instead.

I've also added the DeleteFolders script, to just delete all the folders that match the pattern.
